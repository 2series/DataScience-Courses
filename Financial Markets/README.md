### Financialization of Housing
A short essay on the United Nations Human Rights Council's 2017 report on the financialization of housing (relevant links below). You may either agree or disagree with the report. Your grade should not depend on which side you take, just on how well argued your case is. Try to consider principles from this course about the functioning of financial markets, whose purposes they serve, and how they can solve fundamental economic problems, or, perversely, worsen them.
