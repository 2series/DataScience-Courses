Artificial Intelligence (AI) will define the next generation of software solutions. Human-like capabilities such as understanding natural language, speech, vision, and making inferences from knowledge will extend software beyond the app. The AI track takes aspiring AI engineers from a basic introduction of AI to mastery of the skills needed to build deep learning models for AI solutions that exhibit human-like behavior and intelligence.

Built with the focus of teaching students how to build deep learning predictive models for AI, the Microsoft Professional Program Certificate in Artificial Intelligence will help you learn the skills you need to build the intelligent future.
