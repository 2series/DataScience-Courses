## Reflections on the project

### 1. The Model

**State**
The MPC model defines state in terms of x , y positions, ψ - orientation of the car and v- velocity of the car, cte - the cross track error and epsi - the orientation error. The variables x, y, ψ and v are received from the simulator. The x, y position are in the map coordinates and are converted into the vehicle coordinate system. 

**Actuators**
There are two actuators here: δ - steering angle and a- throttle (which also includes negative acceleration - braking). These are obtained from the result of the solver and passed to the simulator (in main.cpp lines 141-146)

**Update equations**
The new state is obtained from the previous state by applying the kinematic model equations as described in the lectures. These equations were implemented in MPC.cpp staring line 134. 

    x = x + v*cos(ψ)* dt
    y = y + v sin(psi) dt
    v=v+a∗dt
        a in [-1,1]
    ψ=ψ+(v/L_f)*δ∗dt

**Error calculation** 
The key to solving MPC equation is to define the error properly. This required a fair bit of tuning. This is the error that solver tries to minimize. 

As suggested in the lectures, the error included several components:

 for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
      fg[0] += cost_cte* CppAD::pow(vars[cte_start + i] - ref_cte, 2);
      fg[0] += cost_eps* CppAD::pow(vars[epsi_start + i] - ref_epsi, 2);
      fg[0] += cost_v* CppAD::pow(vars[v_start + i] - ref_v, 2);
    }

Above the error varies by deviation from reference CTE (set to zero), reference epsi (set to zero) and ref velocity (set to 40). N is the no. of timesteps we are forecasting into the future. The errors were all multiplied by factors (cost_cte, cost_eps etc) which were very important for smooth driving in the simulator and these multipliers were tuned by trying various values

The error also varied by the actuator values and the change in actuator from previous time step. This ensures smooth changes in actuator values. Again the multipliers associated with them were tuned by looking at performance in the simulator. 

for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
      fg[0] += cost_current_delta*CppAD::pow(vars[delta_start + i], 2);
      fg[0] += cost_current_a*CppAD::pow(vars[a_start + i], 2);
    }

    // Minimize the value gap between sequential actuations.
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 2; i++) {
      fg[0] += cost_diff_delta* CppAD::pow(vars[delta_start + i + 1] - vars[delta_start + i], 2);
      fg[0] += cost_diff_a*CppAD::pow(vars[a_start + i + 1] - vars[a_start + i], 2);
  
    }
The full code is in MPC.cpp lines 65 -87. 

**MPC Setup**
As described in the lectures, the following are the steps for executing MPC

1. Define the length of the trajectory, N, and duration of each timestep, dt.
        See below for definitions of N, dt, and discussion on parameter tuning.

2. Fit polynomial to way points and use that to set the intial cross track error and orientation error
3. Define vehicle dynamics and actuator limitations along with other constraints.
        See the state, actuators and update equations above.
4. Define the cost function.
        Explained above

Once all the model is set and all the parameters are defined, 
1. We pass the current state as the initial state to the model predictive controller.

2. We call the optimization solver. Given the initial state, the solver will return the vector of control inputs that minimizes the cost function. The solver we'll use is called Ipopt.
3. We apply the first control input to the vehicle.
 and  Back to 1.


### 2. Timestep Length and Frequency

* Frequency (dt) - Is the time gap between different time steps. I found dt to be a very important parameter for the overall performance in the simulator. If dt was too low, it led to the car oscillating to and fro around the center of the track. This happens probably because the actuator input is received very quickly and the vehicle is constantly responding. Also if dt is smaller than the latency (0.1 s) then the new actuator signal is received before the previous one has been executed. This leads to jerky motion of the car. On the other hand if dt is too large, the car covers too much distance before the actuator is received and while this leads to smooth performance along the straight portions of the track, it leads to car going off the road on the curves. 

* Timestep length (N) - Is the number of timesteps the model predicts ahead. As N increases, the model predicts further ahead. The further ahead that the model predicts, the more inaccurate those predictions will be. Also if N is large, then a lot more computations need to happen which can lead to inaccurate results from the solver or solver unable to provide the solution in real time. I found that N around 10-15 steps was the best.

Tuning of N and dt
* dt - I tried dt values of 0.10, 0.12, 0.15 and 0.20. I found at 0.10 or below the car oscillated around the center of the track. And at 0.20 while the motion was smooth, the car rolled off the edge of the track around the curve. The best performance was at dt = 0.12.
* N - Once dt was locked, I tried very high N - 30 and motion of the car was very jerky. The car was not very sensitive to N as long as it was in the range between 10 and 15. I finally chosen N =12.

### 3. Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

The x and y coordinates received from the simulator were in the map space. They were converted to vehicle space in main.cpp line 104. Once the coordinates were in the vehicle space, a 3rd degree polynomial was fit to them and then used to calculate CTE. 

### 4. Dealing with latency
The simulator has been setup to have a latency of 0.1 s. This means that the actuator inputs sent to the simulator execute with a delay of 0.1 s. I found that the best approach to dealing with latency is to explicitely account for it in the MPC model. I incorporated latency in the MPC state before passing it to the solver - see MPC.cpp line 175. As a result the solution from the solver - steering and throttle better account for the current state of the vehicle. Also I found that having dt > latency ensured smooth motion in the simulator.

### Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

### Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.

### Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

### Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)

### Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

### Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
