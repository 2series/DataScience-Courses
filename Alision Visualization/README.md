# Description
In the Data science - Visualizing Data and Exploring Models Course, one learns about applying visualizations to data and about feature engineering and constructing machine learning models. 

The course begins by introducing one to exploratory data analysis and data visualization. Learning about functions of exploratory data analysis and what factors can affect your views of data, the different types of charts you can use to visualize your data and, the libraries and packages available in R and Python for visualization. 

Next, you are introduced to building models, including feature engineering and constructing models. THe coures describes what feature engineering is and how to construct a machine learning model in R and Python. You learn about evaluating your model and, how to evaluate a model in Azure ML, R and Python.
