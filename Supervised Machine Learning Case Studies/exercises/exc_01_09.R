# <exercise id="9" title="Using the testing data">
#   
#   "But wait!" you say, because you have been paying attention. ðŸ¤” "That is how these models perform on
#    the *training* data, the data that we used to build these models in the first place." Let's evaluate 
#    how these simple models perform on the testing data.
# 
# **Instructions**
# 
# What do you need to change to evaluate how the models perform on the testing data, instead of 
# the training data?

# <codeblock id="01_09">

# Where you had `car_train` before, switch out to `car_test`.
